# The Personal Chauffeur

You've got that big meeting today and you're all set. Got your presentation polished, your pitch perfect. Your commute is planned down to the second. Now you're on the highway, cruising. 20 minutes early.

But you couldn't plan for these two lanes to be closed and all this sudden construction! You grip the steering wheel, thinking "I'll make it." You inch forward slowly watching the minutes tick by. You need to let the team know you'll be late.
You grab your phone in an ill advised attempt to use your phone while driving in a construction zone. Yes, those are cops are pulling you over now. 

Wouldn't it have been nice to have your Personal Chauffeur warn you this morning that there was new construction on your regular route and that you'd need an extra 20 minutes? Wouldn't it have been great if you Personal Chauffeur had offered to send a message to your team when it was obvious you were going to be late?  

Now everyone can have a Personal Chauffeur with The Personal Chauffeur! Your digital assistant that ensures you get where you're going and executes your backup plan in worst case scenarios.
